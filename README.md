## Overview

RocketMQ Operator is to manage RocketMQ service instances deployed on the Kubernetes cluster.
It is built using the [Operator SDK](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk), which is part of the [Operator Framework](https://github.com/operator-framework/).

## Quick Start

### Prepare Volume Persistence

Currently we provide several ways of your RocketMQ data persistence: ```EmptyDir```, ```HostPath``` and ```NFS```, which can be configured in CR files, for example in ```rocketmq_v1alpha1_nameservice_cr.yaml```:
```
...
 # storageMode can be EmptyDir, HostPath, NFS
  storageMode: HostPath
...
```

If you choose ```EmptyDir```, you don't need to do extra preparation steps for data persistence. But the data storage life is the same with the pod's life, if the pod is deleted you may lost the data.

If you choose other storage modes, please refer to the following instructions to prepare the data persistence.

#### Prepare HostPath

This storage mode means the RocketMQ data (including all the logs and store files) is stored in each host where the pod lies on. In that case you need to create an dir where you want the RocketMQ data to be stored on. 

We provide a script in ```deploy/storage/hostpath/prepare-host-path.sh```, which you can use to create the ```HostPath``` dir on every worker node of your Kubernetes cluster. 

```
$ cd deploy/storage/hostpath

$ sudo su

$ ./prepare-hostpath.sh 
Changed hostPath /data/rocketmq/nameserver uid to 3000, gid to 3000
Changed hostPath /data/rocketmq/broker uid to 3000, gid to 3000
```

You may refer to the instructions in the script for more information.

#### Prepare Storage Class of NFS

If you choose NFS as the storage mode, the first step is to prepare a storage class based on NFS provider to create PV and PVC where the RocketMQ data will be stored. 

1. Deploy NFS server and clients on your Kubernetes cluster. Please make sure they are functional before you go to the next step. Here is a instruction on how to verify NFS service.

    1) On your NFS client node, check if NFS shared dir exists.
    ```
   $ showmount -e 192.168.130.32
   Export list for 192.168.130.32:
   /data/k8s * 
    ```
    2) On your NFS client node, create a test dir and mount it to the NFS shared dir (you may need sudo permission).
    ```
   $ mkdir -p   ~/test-nfc
   $ mount -t nfs 192.168.130.32:/data/k8s ~/test-nfc
    ```
    3) On your NFS client node, create a test file on the mounted test dir.
    ```
   $ touch ~/test-nfc/test.txt
    ```
   4) On your NFS server node, check the shared dir. If there exists the test file we created on the client node, it proves the NFS service is functional.
   ```
   $ ls -ls /data/k8s/
   total 4
   4 -rw-r--r--. 1 root root 4 Jul 10 21:50 test.txt
   ```

2. Modify the following configurations of the ```deploy/storage/nfs-client.yaml``` file:
``` 
...
            - name: NFS_SERVER
              value: 192.168.130.32
            - name: NFS_PATH
              value: /data/k8s
      volumes:
        - name: nfs-client-root
          nfs:
            server: 192.168.130.32
            path: /data/k8s
...
```
Replace ```192.168.130.32``` and ```/data/k8s``` with your true NFS server IP address and NFS server data volume path.
 
3. Create a NFS storage class for RocketMQ, run

```
$ cd deploy/storage
$ ./deploy-storage-class.sh
```
If the storage class is successfully deployed, you can get the pod status like:
```
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nfs-client-provisioner-7cf858f754-7vxmm   1/1     Running   0          136m
```

### Define Your RocketMQ Cluster

RocketMQ Operator provides several CRDs to allow users define their RocketMQ service component cluster, which includes the Namesrv cluster and the Broker cluster.

1. Check the file ```rocketmq_v1alpha1_nameservice_cr.yaml``` in the ```example``` directory, for example:
```
apiVersion: rocketmq.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: NameService
metadata:
  name: name-service
spec:
  # size is the the name service instance number of the name service cluster
  size: 1
  # nameServiceImage is the customized docker image repo of the RocketMQ name service
  nameServiceImage: 2019liurui/rocketmq-namesrv:4.5.0-alpine
  # imagePullPolicy is the image pull policy
  imagePullPolicy: Always
  # storageMode can be EmptyDir, HostPath, NFS
  storageMode: HostPath
  # hostPath is the local path to store data
  hostPath: /data/rocketmq/nameserver
  # volumeClaimTemplates defines the storageClass
  volumeClaimTemplates:
    - metadata:
        name: namesrv-storage
        annotations:
          volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-class: rocketmq-storage
      spec:
        accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ]
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 1Gi
```

which defines the RocketMQ name service (namesrv) cluster scale.

2. Check the file ```rocketmq_v1alpha1_broker_cr.yaml``` in the ```example``` directory, for example:
```
apiVersion: rocketmq.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: Broker
metadata:
  # name of broker cluster
  name: broker
spec:
  # size is the number of the broker cluster, each broker cluster contains a master broker and [replicaPerGroup] replica brokers.
  size: 2
  # nameServers is the [ip:port] list of name service
  nameServers: 192.168.130.33:9876
  # replicationMode is the broker replica sync mode, can be ASYNC or SYNC
  replicationMode: ASYNC
  # replicaPerGroup is the number of each broker cluster
  replicaPerGroup: 1
  # brokerImage is the customized docker image repo of the RocketMQ broker
  brokerImage: 2019liurui/rocketmq-broker:4.5.0-alpine
  # imagePullPolicy is the image pull policy
  imagePullPolicy: Always
  # allowRestart defines whether allow pod restart
  allowRestart: true
  # storageMode can be EmptyDir, HostPath, NFS
  storageMode: HostPath
  # hostPath is the local path to store data
  hostPath: /data/rocketmq/broker
  # scalePodName is broker-[broker group number]-master-0
  scalePodName: broker-0-master-0
  # volumeClaimTemplates defines the storageClass
  volumeClaimTemplates:
    - metadata:
        name: broker-storage
        annotations:
          volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-class: rocketmq-storage
      spec:
        accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ]
        resources:
          requests:
            storage: 8Gi
``` 
which defines the RocketMQ broker cluster scale, the [ip:port] list of name service and so on.

### Deploy RocketMQ Operator & Create RocketMQ Cluster

1. To deploy the RocketMQ Operator on your Kubernetes cluster, please run the following script:

```
$ ./install-operator.sh
```

Use command ```kubectl get pods``` to check the RocketMQ Operator deploy status like:

```
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nfs-client-provisioner-7cf858f754-7vxmm   1/1     Running   0          146m
rocketmq-operator-564b5d75d-jllzk         1/1     Running   0          108s
```
Now you can use the CRDs provide by RocketMQ Operator to deploy your RocketMQ cluster.
 
2. Deploy the RocketMQ name service cluster by running:

``` 
$ kubectl apply -f example/rocketmq_v1alpha1_nameservice_cr.yaml 
nameservice.rocketmq.apache.org/name-service created
```

Check the status:

```
$ kubectl get pods -owide
NAME                                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE     IP               NODE        NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
name-service-0                            1/1     Running   0          3m18s   192.168.130.33   k2data-13   <none>           <none>
nfs-client-provisioner-7cf858f754-7vxmm   1/1     Running   0          150m    10.244.2.114     k2data-14   <none>           <none>
rocketmq-operator-564b5d75d-jllzk         1/1     Running   0          5m53s   10.244.2.116     k2data-14   <none>           <none>
```

We can see that there are 1 name service Pods running on 1 nodes and their IP addresses. Modify the ```nameServers``` field in the ```rocketmq_v1alpha1_broker_cr.yaml``` file using the IP addresses.

3. Deploy the RocketMQ broker clusters by running:
```
$ kubectl apply -f example/rocketmq_v1alpha1_broker_cr.yaml
broker.rocketmq.apache.org/broker created 
```

After a while after the Containers are created, the Kubernetes clusters status should be like:

``` 
$ kubectl get pods -owide
NAME                                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE     IP               NODE        NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
broker-0-master-0                         1/1     Running   0          38s     10.244.4.18      k2data-11   <none>           <none>
broker-0-replica-1-0                      1/1     Running   0          38s     10.244.1.128     k2data-13   <none>           <none>
broker-1-master-0                         1/1     Running   0          38s     10.244.2.117     k2data-14   <none>           <none>
broker-1-replica-1-0                      1/1     Running   0          38s     10.244.3.17      k2data-15   <none>           <none>
name-service-0                            1/1     Running   0          6m7s    192.168.130.33   k2data-13   <none>           <none>
nfs-client-provisioner-7cf858f754-7vxmm   1/1     Running   0          153m    10.244.2.114     k2data-14   <none>           <none>
rocketmq-operator-564b5d75d-jllzk         1/1     Running   0          8m42s   10.244.2.116     k2data-14   <none>           <none>
```

Check the PV and PVC status:
```
$ kubectl get pvc
NAME                                    STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS       AGE

```

> Notice: if you don't choose the NFS storage mode, then the above PV and PVC won't be created.

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed your RocketMQ cluster by RocketMQ Operator.

### Verify the Data Storage

#### Verify HostPath Storage
Access on any node which contains the RocketMQ service pod, check the ```hostPath``` you configured, for example:
```
$ ls /data/rocketmq/broker
logs  store

$ cat /data/rocketmq/broker/logs/broker-1-replica-1/rocketmqlogs/broker.log
...
2019-09-12 13:12:24 INFO main - The broker[broker-1, 10.244.3.35:10911] boot success. serializeType=JSON and name server is 192.168.130.35:9876
...
```

#### Verify NFS storage
Access the NFS server node of your cluster and verify whether the RocketMQ data is stored in your NFS data volume path:

```
$ cd /data/k8s/

$ ls
default-broker-storage-broker-0-master-0-pvc-7a74871b-c005-441a-bb15-8106566c9d19   default-broker-storage-broker-1-replica-1-0-pvc-af266db9-83a9-4929-a2fe-e40fb5fdbfa4

$ cat default-broker-storage-broker-1-master-0-pvc-d7b76efe-384c-4f8d-9e8a-ebe209ba826c/logs/rocketmqlogs/broker.log 
...
2019-09-10 14:12:22 INFO main - The broker[broker-1-master-0, 10.244.2.117:10911] boot success. serializeType=JSON and name server is 192.168.130.33:9876
...
```

## Horizontal Scale

### Name Server Cluster Scale
If the current name service cluster scale does not fit your requirements, you can simply use RocketMQ-Operator to up-scale or down-scale your name service cluster.

If you want to enlarge your name service cluster. Modify your name service CR file ```rocketmq_v1alpha1_nameservice_cr.yaml```, increase the field ```size``` to the number you want, for example, from ```size: 1``` to ```size: 2```.

> Notice: if your broker image version is 4.5.0 or earlier, you need to make sure that ```allowRestart: true``` is set in the broker CR file to enable rolling restart policy. If ```allowRestart: false```, configure it to ```allowRestart: true``` and run ```kubectl apply -f example/rocketmq_v1alpha1_broker_cr.yaml``` to apply the new config.

After configuring the ```size``` fields, simply run 
```
kubectl apply -f example/rocketmq_v1alpha1_nameservice_cr.yaml 
```
Then a new name service pod will be deployed and meanwhile the operator will inform all the brokers to update their name service list parameters, so they can register to the new name service.

> Notice: under the policy ```allowRestart: true```, the broker will gradually be updated so the update process is also not perceptible to the producer and consumer clients.

### Broker Cluster Scale

#### Up-scale Broker in Out-of-order Message Scenario
It is often the case that with the development of your business, the old broker cluster scale no longer meets your needs. You can simply use RocketMQ-Operator to up-scale your broker cluster:

1. Modify the ```size``` in the broker CR file to the number that you want the broker cluster scale will be, for example, from ```size: 1``` to ```size: 2```.

2. Choose the source broker pod, from which the old metadata like topic and subscription information data will be transferred to the newly created brokers. The source broker pod field is 
```
...
# scalePodName is broker-[broker group number]-master-0
  scalePodName: broker-0-master-0
...
```

3. Apply the new configurations:
```
kubectl apply -f example/rocketmq_v1alpha1_broker_cr.yaml
```
Then a new broker group of pods will be deployed and meanwhile the operator will copy the metadata from the source broker pod to the newly created broker pods before the new brokers are stared, so the new brokers will reload previous topic and subscription information.

## Clean the Environment
If you want to tear down the RocketMQ cluster, to remove the broker clusters run

```
$ kubectl delete -f example/rocketmq_v1alpha1_broker_cr.yaml
```

to remove the name service clusters:

```
$ kubectl delete -f example/rocketmq_v1alpha1_nameservice_cr.yaml
```

to remove the RocketMQ Operator:

```
$ ./purge-operator.sh
```

to remove the storage class for RocketMQ:

```
$ cd deploy/storage
$ ./remove-storage-class.sh
```

> Note: the NFS persistence data will not be deleted by default.


```kubectl apply -f rocketmq-operator.yaml```

```kubectl apply -f rocketmq-cluster.yaml```
